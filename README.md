# io_scene_sonic_heroes_anm

This plugin for Blender 3D allows you to import and export RenderWare animations (`.anm`) for Sonic Heroes. Based on [Renderware-.anm-IO-Tool](https://github.com/Shadowth117/Renderware-.anm-IO-Tool).

Poorly tested. Animation export may be incorrect due to broken keyframe sorting. To solve this problem, you can enable the "Create intermediate" option, but with this, the exported file will be larger in size.

## How to import animation

1. Import DFF model into Blender
2. Make armature active
3. Import ANM animation

## Requirements

* Blender 3D (2.81 and higher)
* [DragonFF](https://github.com/Parik27/DragonFF)
